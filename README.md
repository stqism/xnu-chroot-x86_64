xnu-chroot-x86_64
=================
A Debian sid Linux chroot designed to compile darwin for arm

The xnu folder is at the root, everything else has been taken care of.

Note: you'll need a /dev, /proc, and /sys for the sanity of clang.

Some form of ``sudo mount -o bind /dev dev`` for all 3 would work perfectly.
