This is the Debian prepackaged version of flex, the fast lexical
analyzer generator.

This package was first put together by Robert Leslie <rob@mars.org>.
It is currently maintained by Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>,
who took over from Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>, 
and it is built from sources obtained from:
