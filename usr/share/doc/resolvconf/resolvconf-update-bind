# Need bash because we use ${foo//bar/baz}
#
# Example script illustrating how to write a dynamic BIND named
# options file containing an up-to-date fowarders list.
#
# To use the dynamically generated file, include it from named.conf.
# 
# This example was prepared for BIND version 8.  For use with BIND 9
# the script should first be modified so that it generates only the
# forwarders{} substatement, not the whole options{} statement.
# Much safer. See http://bugs.debian.org/483098 for the request that
# such a file be included in the bind9 package.
#
# Resolvconf may run this script even if named is not running.
# If a bind package is installed then we go ahead and update
# the named configuration in case named is started later.
#
# Assumption: On entry, PWD contains the resolv.conf-type files.

# First, we do our best to delete all and only comments.
# Then we delete any existing forwarders statement, taking into account
# the fact that these can span several lines.  Then we add a new
# forwarders statement at the beginning of the options statement.
